### 🚀 Our Vision

We believe the future of AI is not in a distant cloud, but right here, on your own machine. Our mission is to build a suite of open-source tools and a flagship AI companion, **LocalKin**, that gives you full control over your data and your digital life. Privacy, power, and personalization are at the core of everything we do.

### 🤖 Our Projects / The Ecosystem

Our ecosystem is a collection of powerful, standalone tools that come together in our flagship application, **LocalKin**.
